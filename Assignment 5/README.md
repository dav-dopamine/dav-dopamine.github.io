1. Goal is to find all possible valid strings by removing the fewest parentheses. I decided to use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore different combinations of removals while tracking how many left and right parentheses need to be eliminated.The time complexity is O(2^n) bc of the potential need to explore all combinations. 

Input: "()())()"  
Output: \["(())()", "()()()"\]  
Expected Output: \["(())()", "()()()"\]

Input: "(a)())()"  
Output: \["(a())()", "(a)()()"\]  
Expected Output: \["(a())()", "(a)()()"\]

Input: ")(("  
Output: \[""\]  
Expected Output: \[""\]

Input: "(())(((("  
Output: \["(())"\]  
Expected Output: \["(())"\]

Input: "((()"  
Output: \["()"\]  
Expected Output: \["()"\]

2. We want to find the minimum difference between values in a Binary Search Tree (BST), Understanding properties of the tree an in-order traversal would give the node values in a sorted order making it easier to calculate the minimum difference between occurring values. So using depth-first search approach to traverse the tree while keeping track of the previous node value. Each time I visited a node I find the difference between its value and the previous one updating my minimum difference. the time complexity is O(n) since each node is visited exactly once during the traversal.

3. We keep track of both the current node and the visited nodes and their states.Using a breadth-first search because it helps explore all paths level by level so we can find the shortest path efficiently. Using a queue to hold pairs of the current node and the bitmask are the visited nodes so we can check if all nodes had been visited. A 2D boolean array is used to keep track of visited states. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 \* 2^n) where n is the number of nodes because we explore combinations of visited nodes for each node.

4. The goal of finding the maximum path sum in a binary tree We use a depth-first search bc it allows exploration each path fully before going back. Created a variable to hold the max path sum. We go thru the tree recursively, calculating the maximum path sum for both the left and right children of each node. Also ensuring the current path sum which includes the node's value and the maximum sums from its children is greater than the previous max.  In order to update the maximum value when a larger sum is found. The time complexity of this is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree bc each node is visited exactly once.

5. The problem is to generate numbers in lexical order up to a given integer n. Using depth first search  to explore each potential number. We start with the smalles t number and using a variable to keep track of the current value to append to the result list whilst multiplying the current element by 10 to ensure it is in the limit of n. When we are unable to go deeper we adjust the current value to ensure the next number is valid and maintaining the right order. The time complexity is O(n) bc it creates each of the n numbers exactly once to add to the result list.
