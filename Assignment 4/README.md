**1\) Top K Frequent Elements:** The goal is to identify the most frequent elements efficiently. Using a HashMap to store the amount of each element, then keeping only the top k most occurring elements with the min-heap. Continuing to add to the frequency map keeping heap size limited to k. If the heap grew larger the least frequent element gets removed so the most frequent ones stay. The heap operations are O(log k) and the process runs in O(n log k) time where n is the number of unique elements.

**2\) Find K Closest Elements:** First the input array is converted into a list of boxed integers that are using Java streams for easier sorting. The sorting will compare elements based on their difference from the target. If two elements are equally close we will prioritize the smaller one inorder to maintain order. When the sorting is done only first k elements are taken. We then sort again so that they are in ascending order. The time complexity is O(n log n) from the sorting steps where n is the length of the input array.

**3\) K Largest Elements of a Max Heap:** We use a priority queue to keep track of the index of each element in the given array which will allow for quick access to the largest elements. First off the index of the first element is added to the queue and the while loop will keep going as long as there are elements to process and k remains greater than zero. We are able to get the index of the largest element from polling the priority queue and we then add the result list. Next we calculate the indexes for the left and right children and add them to the queue if they exist so that we are able to go through the tree. The time complexity is O(k log n) where n is the number of elements in the array and since each insertion and removal from the priority queue is O(log n) time. 

Test Case 1  
Input: elements \= \[5, 3, 8, 1, 2\], count \= 3  
Expected Output: \[8, 5, 3\]  
Output: \[8, 5, 3\]

**4\) Shortest Subarray with Sum at least K:** The goal is to find the shortest subarray that sums to at least the value which is K. First we calculate the prefix sum so that subarray sums are easier to find. Using a deque to maintain positions of starting points for valid subarrays. As we are going through the prefix sums we check the difference between the current sum and the sums at the stored positions in the deque that meet the requirement. And we update the minimum length found so far if valid. And we continue until all possible subarrays are gone through. Time complexity of this is O(n) where n is the length of the input array.

**5\) Kth Smallest Prime Fraction:** First we set up a priority queue to deal with any potential fractions that may occur. Going through the array and adding the fractions formed from each prime in relation to the others. And for each fraction we get from the queue we also checked if there were any remaining fractions to be formed using the next numerator and we will add these new fractions into the queue. So that all of the added fractions are in the right order. We keep at it until K fractions are retrieved inorder to get the kth smallest fraction. Time complexity of this solution is O(k log n) where n is the number of prime numbers.
